    <p>[by <a href="mailto:jason@hikehumbly.org">Jason</a>] How long has it been since you set up your tent? Where is it anyway? Did you shove it up in the top of a closet somewhere? Or maybe it’s in the attic. Or, wait, could you have sold it a few years back at that garage sale? If you’re having to scratch your head for more than a few seconds trying to answer these questions, it’s been too long.</p>

<p>For many of us, camping is something we did when we were kids. But in the years since, daily life may have gotten a little too complicated to schedule an overnight in the woods. I get it! Managing family responsibilities and job demands are full time endeavors. Add in gear expense, food considerations, first aid needs, and location choices and the excuses pile up. What if I told you, though, that making the time for camping is worth it.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, routine is important. Having careers and families necessitate following a schedule. We wake up to an alarm so that we can be where we need to be on time. We shop at the grocery store weekly so that we can have a stocked refrigerator and pantry. We keep track of our budget so we can pay bills promptly. We jump in the car at just the right moment to beat the traffic on the way home. Maintaining this regularity can help keep our priorities straight and our anxiety low.</p>

<p>Except when it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Occasionally the routine can work against us. After following our schedule day in and day out for awhile, autopilot can take the wheel. One day we look around and don’t know where we are anymore. We’re just going through the motions, watching life fly by.</p>

<p>Religious traditions offer a remedy to this feeling of “stuckness” that mind<i>less</i> routines can create. Buddhists talk about becoming more mind<i>ful</i> and encourage meditation as a strategy. Christians suggest different forms of prayer that aim at centering our thoughts and hearts on our creator. Each method, or practice, urges us to be awake and oriented in the present moment, conscious of our inner world and of the physical world we inhabit. These traditions teach that this heightened awareness can make us more available to the voice of God in our lives and help us to better understand who and where we truly are – to turn off the autopilot and reengage.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to practice. Traditionally, churches or zendos offer  opportunities for worship or sitting. These time honored methods resonate for many, but for those less suited to structured worship or meditation, or those looking to compliment their traditional spiritual practices, simply spending time outdoors can promote mindfulness. Camping, another time honored discipline, can jumpstart the journey to a more intentional, engaged life.</p>

<p>Camping invites us out of our routine and into the present moment. We have to think intentionally about what we will eat and where we will sleep – things we take for granted in civilized society. If we are hiking, we have to monitor and adjust our pack position and weight, watch closely where we step, be alert to changes in the weather, and keep up with our food and water intake. If we’re with a group we have to pay attention to our companions and regulate our pace depending on the needs of others. When camping, there is no other place to be than the present moment. We have no choice but to be where we are.</p>

<p>How long has it been since you set up your tent? Need some practice?</p>
